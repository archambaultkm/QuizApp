Due to its ability to work with memory directly, C++ is often used to program what?$$low-level systems that require the direct manipulation of memory, ex. drivers
This is the automatic reclamation (deterministically or non-deterministically) of memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced (being used).$$Garbage collection
What type of garbage collection does C++ employ?$$Deterministic
You would use this if an object is destroyed explicitly by applying the delete operator to a base-class pointer to the object, where the base-class destructor function (matching the pointer type) is called on the object, not the destructor most appropriate to the class being destroyed.$$Virtual base class destructor
When an object is created, its state can be initialized by this type of method. In most object-oriented languages, this method would have the same name as the class and would be created automatically if the programmer did not create one.$$Constructor
C++ has this additional feature to establish the state of an object (the values in its properties at the time of instantiation) that is not a feature of all object-oriented languages:$$Initializer list
This is the “blueprint” for an object. It is the code that defines an object, and all objects are created (instanced) based on this. It is an abstraction of a real-world concept, and it provides the basis from which we create instances of specific objects.$$Class
This is the concept that a new class can be based on an existing class. This is done by extending (adding to) these behaviors from the existing class through a process known as sub classing or generalization.$$Inheritance
This is when we include objects as instance variables (members) of other classes:$$Composition
In C++, the break statement causes immediate exit when executed in specific selection and repetition statements. This includes the ________ statements.$$Switch statements.
What is true about function prototypes (aka function declarations) regarding their invocation, definition, order, and requirement?$$Must be declared before they are invoked
What is true about function signatures regarding their scope and the compilers’ matching of parameters during a call?$$They must match exactly
Which is the correct header for using strings from the C++ Standard Library of Headers?$$#include <string>
The C++ Standard Library class template vector is used to create?$$Dynamic arrays
An array is a contiguous group of memory locations that all have the same type. To refer to a single storage location of an array we refer to its name and _________ (see below) in square brackets.$$Index
array<int,5>myArray={1,2,3,4,5}; is an example of the use of what?$$Array initialization
When creating an integer array, if there are fewer initializers than array elements, which of the following happens?$$Garbage data
When you use the [ ] operator to access an array element that does not exist (is said to be 'out of bounds'), what occurs?$$Undefined behaviour
The C++ 11 range-based 'for' statement is better than a counter-controlled statement for accessing an array for what reason?$$No counter or end condition
The statement "using namespace std" means what?$$all names in the std namespace can be used without specifying manually
